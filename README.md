# Predicting-apartment-prices-in-Seoul

### Outline
* We follow these steps to predict house prices of the apartments in Seoul.

1. Program Setting and Data Loading
2. Preprocessing features
>* numeric & categorical variables (imputation & encoding)
>* adding new features & regularization
3. Implementation of models and algorithms
>* Random Forests
>* XGBoost
>* Support vector regression
>* k-nearest neighbors
>* Multi-layer perceptron
4. Fitting, prediction and evaluation


### Research questions
* The questions we want to answer by doing this analysis are as follows.

1. Which machine (model) is the best model to predict apartment prices of Seoul?
2. What is the set of characteristics (features) related to the apartments that should be considered to predict house prices effectively?
